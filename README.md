# JustJava
Just Java is a coffee ordering application

This application allows a user to choose the amount of coffee cups the user would like to order.
Additionally, this application allows the user to choose from two toppings to add to the coffee, which changes the price.

Once the order has been completed, and the user submits the order using the button, the order summary is then emailed to the user as a receipt.
